### Code Repository
There will be a bunch of examples coming the next weeks. There is an update of this repository from time to time to correct bugs or add new examples. There are two ways to get all these files.

1. __PREFERRED__: In Visual Studio Code click the "Files" Icon, then "Clone Repository", paste the Repository URL https://github.com/HybridThingsLab/course-teachable-machines, hit Enter, create a folder for our files and select it as download location.
2. Fallback: Download the repository from the GitHub Website (https://github.com/HybridThingsLab/course-teachable-machines/archive/master.zip). Use button "Clone or Download" on the top right side of the page, download the ZIP and extract it.

Whenever there is an update to the repository, you can pull those changes to your local folder structure:

* Click the "Source Control" icon
* Click the three little dots above the file list
* Click "pull"

### Make it your code!
Please create your own code folder somewhere outside our code folder and copy one of the example folders over. You should not chage anythinig inside our code structure because it may interfere with future updates that we may do on the code if you use GIT (Collisions)
